# Contributing

## Got an Idea?

So you’ve got a great idea to throw into **sensei**? Awesome!

Your contribution **will**
get noticed, and **will** be appreciated, not only by the users of **sensei**,
but also…

* By other open-source enthusiasts;
* By your friends and colleagues;
* And by your *potential* employers.

### Workflow

Are you experiencing a problem? Do you need a feature? Then, try
**[forking][forkrepo]** the repository, implementing it yourself, and then
sending a **[pull request][PR]**.

Please keep the following in mind:

* If your contribution changes any existing behavior, make sure to update the
documentation and **[README](README.md)**.
* Please follow the styling and conventions of the file you are working on. **In lieu of a formal styleguide, please take care to maintain the existing coding style.**
* If you add unit tests, and find us, we’ll buy you a beverage.
* Please do your best to submit **small pull requests**; it will make it
easier to review your proposed change.
* When submitting a pull request, please make judicious use of the pull request body. At the very least, write a description of what changes were made and the motivations behind the changes.

> Your solution does not need to be perfect. It will be a starting point to discuss and develop.

Here’s the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

* Fork the project.
* [Clone down your fork][clone].
* Create a topic branch to contain your change (`git checkout -b feature/my_awesome_feature` ).
* Hack away.
* Push the branch up ( `git push origin feature/my_awesome_feature` ).
* [Create a pull request][PR], and describe what your change does and the why you think it should be merged.

## Add Tests

> There is no such thing as “too many tests”. Feel free to add
> additional tests to the **test** folder.

## I Don’t Write Code, How Can I Help You?

There are several ways you can add value, and actively coding is just one of
them. Here are several **other** ways to contribute:

### Use **sensei** in Your Projects

Send your feedback if you use **sensei** in your projects.

You can **[open an issue][issues]** to share your comments and suggestions, for instance.

### Spread the Word Around

Do you have a blog? Write about **sensei**.

Do you use Facebook? Then share **sensei** on **Facebook**.

Are you a tweeter? Then tweet about **sensei**.

### Raise New Issues

Have an idea, have a suggestion? &ndash; Then **[open an issue][issues]** for that.

Bonus points if you start actually implementing it **;)**.

### Trace and Diagnose an Issue

Issues are generally poorly reported.

When you diagnose a bug and come up with additional findings, sharing them as **comments** under the issue will help people save time.

So try to figure out the specifics of the problem:

* Is it reproducible, or is it ad-hoc?
* What are the steps to reproduce the problem?
* What's the OS/User Agent that the problem occurs?
* Can you narrow the problem down? (*e.g., it work in one platform,
but fails in another*)

Add your findings to the issue as comments for everyone else to see. Your efforts will definitely make it easier for someone else to fix the issue.

### Help with the Documentation

Documentations generally suffer from having been written from the point of view of the people who are familiar with the project.

> The vision of someone just **getting into** the project is ultimately necessary to create a good documentation:
>
> If you see things that are missing, or counter-intuitive in the documentation, **suggest an update**, by either forking it, or [opening a new issue][issues].
>
> Most of the things are taken for granted may not be so apparent when you are not familiar with the project.

### Seek the Code for Hidden “TODO” Items

You can `grep -RIn TODO .` and either **fork** the repository and try to fix them yourself; or you can **[open an issue][issues]** for them.

### Add a Comment

When you’re reading the code, you can find parts of it tricky or confusing.

If you find them confusing, someone else also will.

Even if you cannot find the purpose of an algorithm update, you can always add a comment in the code asking for further documentation and clarification.
